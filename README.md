# UI Assessment - Pok√©dex (Senior)

Requirements for this can be found on the home page of the app or [here](./src/README.md)

# Notes from Chris on implementation
- Installed MUI dependencies for for MUI Dialog
- Left comment regarding necessity of memoization on properties on the `data` result object
- Added jest tests into `src/app/tests/App.test.tsx` but as they are not required for the assessment and to make sure I got this turned in with plenty of time to spare, I did not add the things necessary to run these tests
