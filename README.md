# UI Assessment - Pok√©dex (Senior)

Requirements for this can be found on the home page of the app or [here](./src/README.md)

# Notes from Chris on implementation
- Installed MUI dependencies for for MUI components
- Used MUI Table for list - wasn't clear if this is allowed because the README states 'list items' but with the amount and type of data, a table would be more reasonable than a set of list items containing divs or anything like that
- Left comment regarding necessity of memoization on properties on the `data` result object
